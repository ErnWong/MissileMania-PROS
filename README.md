Macbot's Missile Mania Robot 1 (in PROS)
========================================

*The code for 9098A's Missile Mania robot 1, this time using the Purdue Robotics Operating System.*

### Dependencies

You'll need to install the [PROS IDE](http://purdueros.sourceforge.net/) first (so that the tools needed are also installed).

(If the ide doesn't run, try installing 64 bit Java.)

### Usage

First, get a copy of the code by either downloading the zip, or clone with git
in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ErnWong/MissileMania-PROS.git
```

To compile, run `make`.

To upload the program to your bot, connect your bot and run `make upload`.

To clean up the compiled mess, run `make clean`.
